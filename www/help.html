                    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                        dedicated students as part
                        of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                        limit
                        work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span> leverages the principles
                        of kanban to help users
                        manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

                    <h2>How to use it</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span>Join</span>:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                            <p>
                                When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents
                                your project and
                                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                            <p>
                                In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                                "Contacts" section, click
                                on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can
                                be assigned
                                tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                            <p>
                                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                individual tasks.
                                Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task
                                details in
                                the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                            <p>
                                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                                dragging and
                                dropping the card from one
                            </p>
                        </li>
